# Outpost‑Core

Outpost‑Core is the contract suite that powers **Outpost** a fully on‑chain, strategy tower‑defense game set in the Gotchipus universe.

## What is Outpost?

- **Chain‑native tower defense**  
  Every building upgrade, monster wave, and combat resolution lives on‑chain, providing deterministic gameplay and verifiable state.

- **NFT‑backed bases**  
  Each Outpost is an ERC‑721 token that represents a persistent, upgradeable seafloor base. Ownership is transferable and composable with DeFi and other GameFi protocols.

- **AI‑driven guardians**  
  Players summon Gotchipus—autonomous AI companions—and program their behavior through on‑chain Hooks, creating customizable defense logic.

- **PVE & PVP**  
  Defend against Abyssal corruption in solo play, or raid rival Outposts in competitive modes. All actions and outcomes are enforced by the same contract layer.

- **Modular architecture**  
  Built with the Diamond Standard (EIP‑2535) and ERC‑6551 smart accounts, Outpost‑Core is designed for seamless upgrades and feature extensions.
